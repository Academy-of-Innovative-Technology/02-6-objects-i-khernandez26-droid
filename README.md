# 🔁 REVIEW: JavaScript Objects

Objects are a JavaScript data type used to store **related information** such as:
- Properties
- Arrays
- Boolean values
- Functions (methods)

In this review, you will practice **reading object data**, **creating new objects**, and **looping through objects** using JavaScript.

## 📋 Instructions

### 1️⃣ Review the Existing Object (`theranos`)

You are given an object named **`theranos`**.

#### a. Display Full Name
Print the **last name and first name together** in the HTML using this format:

**Holmes, Elizabeth**

#### b. Calculate Birth Year
- Use the current year and the `age` property from the object
- Display the result in the HTML using this format:

Year Born: ##


---

#### c. Display Education

Print each college attended using the following format:

First College: St. John ...

Second College: Stanford ...

---

#### d. Create Link to Wikipedia

- Update the button link with the wiki property.

---

### 2️⃣ Create a New Object (Elon Musk)

Create a new object with the following properties:

- `firstName`: Elon
- `middleName`: (your choice)
- `lastName`: Musk
- `age`: 48
- `education`:
  - Queens College
  - Stanford University
  - Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania

📌 Display all the properties to the HTML using the **same formatting** in HTML Profil 2 as in Step 1.

---

#### d. Create Link to Wikipedia

- Find Elon Musk Wikipedia profile

- Update the button link with the wiki property.

- Add this object to the **`profiles` array**

---

## ✅ Requirements

Your JavaScript file must include:

- At least 3 **object**
- At least 1 **iterator** (`for`, `forEach`)
- HTML matches the required formatting

---

## ⭐ Challenge

- Merge the **two created objects** into a single array
- Use **one iterator** to display all properties for both objects in the console

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this review, you will demonstrate your ability to:
- Read and access object properties
- Create new objects
- Work with arrays inside objects
- Use loops to display object data
